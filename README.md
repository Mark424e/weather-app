# Weather App

This is a simple application that fetches data from api.openweathermap.org, which enables the user to enter any location and receive the current weather information.
This project was created with React.JS and uses TailwindCSS as a framework.


## Goal

The goal of this project is to improve myself with React.JS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS and data fetching from APIs.
